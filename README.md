This repository is for my video-by-video progress of different modules of the Introduction to LangGraph course by LangChain Academy. 
I have written my learnings and my work of each video of the Modules below:

# Module 1 video 1
Learnings:
So from this video, I learned that LangGraph is an open-source orchestration framework which helps to design custom agent workflows using states, nodes and edges for better control and reliability.Â 
LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use. LangGraph does not require LangChain but works well with it to build complex and stateful agents. 
I got to learn about the basic LangGraph components- about what the states, nodes and edges do.
LangChain is for quick model interactions but LangGraph gives deeper control and flexibility. 
I also learned how LangGraph enables developers to create reliable human-in-the-loop systems with durable and long-running task execution.

Changes:
This lesson was a theoretical explanation of the topic and did not have any source code to make changes to.
